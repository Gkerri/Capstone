                            <p><strong>Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome</strong>, or <em>(HLHS)</em>, is congenital heart disease, meaning that a child is born with. HLHS occurs in about 1 out of 3,500 to 12,500 live births. This works out to approximately 56 to 126 infants in Canada each year.</p>
                            <p>In this condition, the left ventricle, or pumping chamber, doesn't develop normally and is too small. This means that it cannot pump blood efficiently, if at all. Instead, the right side of the heart must pump blood to the lungs and to the rest of the body.

                            <h4>Diagnosis and Symptoms</h4>
                                <p>HLHS is often diagnosed during pregnancy, between 18-24 weeks. This is usually when a woman goes for her anatomy ultrasound. During the ultrasound, the technician will take measurements of the baby and alert the doctor if something is wrong. In this case, the four-chamber view of the heart is inconclusive. This is when the pregnant mother will be sent for a special ultrasound called a Fetal Echocardiogram.
                                <p>In cases where HLHS is not diagnosed in utero, the newborn may experience symptoms such as:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Rapid, labored breathing</li>
                                        <li> Blue colouring of the skin, lips, or finger nails</li>
                                        <li>Poor feeding</li>
                                        <li>Cold hands and feet</li>
                                        <li>Weak pulse</li>
                                        <li>Being more drowsy or less active than is typical for newborns</li>
                                    </ul>

                            <h4>Treatments</h4>
                                <p>Advances in care have greatly improved the outlook for babies born with HLHS. Treatment for HLHS may include:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Medications</li>

                                        <li>In some cases a heart transplant</li>

                                    <p>There are many medications given to newborns who have HLHS. Some before surgery, some after surgery, and some are for life. Below are just some of the medications and their uses:</p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Alprostadil: Keeps the Ductus Arteriosus open.</li>
                                            <li>Prostaglandin: Keeps the Ductus Arteriosus open.</li>
                                            <li>Inotropic agents: Such as dopamine, dobutamine, or milrinone.</li>
                                            <li>Diuretics Agents: such as furosemide aka Lasix.</li>
                                            <li>Cardiac Glycosides: such as Digoxin</li>
                                            <li>Afterload-reducing Agents: such as captopril or enalapril.</li>
                                            <li>Antiplatelet agents: such as potassium chloride</li>

                                <h5>Surgical Repair</h5>
                                    <p>HLHS is most commonly treated with a three step  surgical plan that redirects bloodflow to compensate for the hypoplastic ventricle.

                                                <p class="ol1">The Norwood Procedure is ususally performed in the first few days of a baby's life. This operation aims to mix blood adequately at the atrial level, allow unobstructed blood flow through the aorta, and provide a stable source of pulmonary blood flow. This is done by creating a new aorta and shunt to allow the right ventricle to pump blood to the body and the lungs.</p>
                                                <p class="ol1">During the procedure, the surgeon will create the new aorta, join the bottom of the pulmonary artery to the aorta, create a shunt to carry blood to the lungs, close the Patent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA), and open the Atrial Septal Default to allow blood to flow back into the right ventricle.</p>

                                                <p class="ol1">The Glenn Procedure reroutes blood from the upper body to the lungs, bypassing the heart.  The Glenn is usually performed when a child is 4-6 months old.</p>
                                                <p class="ol1">During this procedure, the surgeon will disconnect the Superior Vena Cava (SVC) from the heart and connecting it to the pulmonary artery.The Glenn Procedure is important because it perpares the heart and lungs for the Fontan Procedure, which is the third surgery that creates a more passive type of lung circulation.</p>

                                                <p class="ol1">The Fontan Procedure is the final surgery that improves circulation for children with HLHS. This procedure involves rerouting blood from the lower half of the body directly to the lungs, bypassing the heart. This procedure is typically performed when a child is older than 18 months and no later than 5 years.</p> 
                                                <p class="ol1">During this procedure, the surgeon disconnects the Inferior Vena Cava (IVC) from the heart and connects it to the pulmonary artery. Sometimes the surgeon will create a small hole, called a fenestration, between the conduit and the right atrium. This acts as a pop-off valve to prevent pressure from building up around the lungs.</p>

                                    <p>No surgical plan is without complications. In the case of HLHS, these complications can include:</p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Exercise Intolerance</li>

                                    <p>Sometimes the defect is too severe to be a candidate for surgery. Sometimes parents decline treatments for Religious or Cultural reasons. In these cases, the healthcare team will offer comfort care. Comfort Care is when you sign for no medical interventions. The team will either keep you in hospital, a hospice, or your own home and provide medications to keep your newborn as comfortable as possible. This gives the parents and the family a chance to meet their baby and love them for as long as possible. The life expectancy for an infant without treatment is a few hours to a few days, depending on the severity of the disease. The nurses for comfort care are trained to counsel family members and assist in making keepsakes like photo albums, footprints, and casts of hands or feet.

                            <p>Every case of HLHS is unique. Some cases are severe and some cases are not. There are cases of HLHS where the child must stay in the hospital from birth until after the Glenn Procedure, and sometimes longer. These babies often need oxygen support and feeding tubes. Other cases are a bit easier, and the child can go home during the interstage period. These babies may still need oxygen and feeding supports, while some do not need these supports at home. Some HLHS babies struggle to gain weight. Some may need to have the Glenn earlier or later than recommended due to each unique set of circumstances.
