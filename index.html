            <h2>What is Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome?</h2>
                <h3><u>Overview</u></h3>
                <p>Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome (HLHS) is a rare heart condition that a child is born with. In this condition, the left ventricle, or pumping chamber, doesn't develop normally and is too small. This means that it cannot pump blood efficiently, if at all. Instead, the right side of the heart must pump blood to the lungs and to the rest of the body.

                    </p>
                <h3><u>Diagnosis and Symptoms</u></h3>
                    <p>HLHS is often diagnosed during pregnancy, between 18-24 weeks, when a woman goes for her anatomy scan.
                    </p>
                    <p>In cases where HLHS is not diagnosed in utero, the symptoms include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>rapid, labored breathing</li>
                            <li> blue colouring of the skin, lips, or finger nails</li>
                            <li>poor feeding</li>
                            <li>Cold hands and feet</li>
                            <li>Weak pulse</li>
                            <li>Being more drowsy or less active than is typical for newborns</li>
                        </ul>
    
                <h3><u>Treatments</u></h3>
                    <p>Advances in care have greatly improved the outlook for babies born with HLHS.</p>
                    <p>Treatment for HLHS may include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Medications</li> <li>Three-stage surgical reconstruction</li>
                            <li>In some cases a heart transplant</li>
                        </ul>
                    <h4>Medications</h4>
                        <!-- <p>medications and what they do</p> -->
                    <h4>Surgical Repair</h4>
                        <p>HLHS is most commonly treated with a three step  surgical plan that redirects bloodflow to compensate for the hypoplastic ventricle.

                            <p>Sometimes the defect is too severe to be a candidate for surgery. Sometimes parents decline treatments for Religious or Cultural reasons. In these cases, the healthcare team will offer comfort care. Comfort Care is when you sign for no medical interventions. The team will either keep you in hospital, a hospice, or your own home and provide medications to keep your newborn as comfortable as possible. This gives the parents and the family a chance to meet their baby and love them for as long as possible. The life expectancy for an infant without treatment is a few hours to a few days, depending on the severity of the disease. The nurses for comfort care are trained to counsel family members and assist in making keepsakes like photo albums, footprints, and casts of hands or feet.
