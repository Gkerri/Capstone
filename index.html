                <h4>Comfort Care</h4>
                    <p>Sometimes the heart is too damaged to be a candidate for surgery. Sometimes parents decide against the surgery for Religious or Cultural reasons. In these cases, the healthcare team will offer comfort care. Comfort Care is when you sign for no medical interventions. The team will either keep you in hospital or maybe a hospice and provide pain killers to keep your newborn as comfortable as possible. Basically, this gives the parents and the family a chance to meet their baby and love him for as long as he has. Some babies last a few hours, some last a day or two. The nurse for comfort care are trained to counsel family members and assist in making keepsakes like photo albums, footprints, and casts of hands or feet.</p>
